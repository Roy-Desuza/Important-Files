I was not able to crack the full code of Eureka! Ameesha knows the rest of the code. She saved it in some online platform , she gave me a hint that "it goes with 
copy and with cut but always after them" and the second part is a "receptacle in which to deposit rubbish" then I can apply at locator "/iPkmqZYz" ...... 
no idea what it means , I could never figure it out , I hope Rajat never gets to it.....
